# How to change visibility of toolbar buttons and menu items in print preview


<p>This example demonstrates how to use the <strong>PrintingSystem.SetCommandVisibility</strong> method to change the visibility of the toolbar buttons and menu items shown in the Print Preview of a document in a Windows Forms application.</p><p>The code here hides the <strong>Watermark</strong> toolbar button and the corresponding menu item, makes the <strong>DocumentMap</strong> toolbar button and menu item visible, and also makes the <strong>ExportToCsv</strong> and <strong>ExportToTxt</strong> commands visible in both the window's menu, and in the toolbar. Note that a list of all the commands is represented by the <strong>PrintingSystemCommand</strong> enumeration.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2304">E2304</a>.</p>
